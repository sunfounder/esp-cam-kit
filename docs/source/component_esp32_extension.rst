ESP32 Camera Extension
=======================

We have designed an expansion board that enables you to fully utilize the camera and SD card functionalities of the ESP32 WROOM 32E. By combining the OV2640 camera, Micro SD, and ESP32 WROOM 32E, you get an all-in-one expansion board.

The board provides two types of GPIO headers - one with female headers, perfect for quick prototyping projects. The other type features screw terminals, ensuring stable wire connections and making it suitable for IoT projects.

Additionally, you can power your project using a single 3.7V 18650 battery. If the battery runs low, you can conveniently charge it by simply plugging in a 5V Micro USB cable. This makes it a great tool for outdoor projects and remote applications.

Pin Mapping Tables
--------------------------------

The ESP32 WROOM 32E's pinout diagram can be found in :ref:`esp32_pinout`. 

However, when the ESP32 WROOM 32E is inserted into the extension board, some of its pins may also be used to drive the Micro SD card or a camera. 

Consequently, pull-up or pull-down resistors have be added to these pins. If you're using these pins as inputs, it's crucial to account for these resistors as they can affect input levels.

.. note::

    The onboard 8M PSRAM provides ample RAM for the camera. PSRAM occupies IO16 and IO17. Therefore, the expansion header and expansion screw terminal do not extend IO16 and IO17.

Here's the pinout table for the right-side pins:

    .. note::

        There are some specific constraints:

        * **IO33** is connected to a 4.7K pull-up resistor and a filtering capacitor, which prevents it from driving the WS2812 RGB Strip.

Interface Insertion Guide
-------------------------------

**Upload Code**

    When you need to upload code to the ESP32 WROOM 32E, connect it to your computer using a Micro USB cable.

**Inserting the Micro SD Card**

    Gently push in the Micro SD card to secure it in place. Pushing it again will eject it.

        :align: center

**Attaching the Camera**

    When connecting the camera, ensure the black stripe of the FPC cable is facing upwards and is fully inserted 
    into the connector.

            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>

**Battery Power and Charging**

    Carefully insert the battery cable into the battery port, avoiding applying too much force to prevent pushing up the battery terminal. If the terminal is pushed up, it's okay as long as the pins are not broken; you can simply press it back into position.
